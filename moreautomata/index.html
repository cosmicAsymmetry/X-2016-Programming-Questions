						<h1>Programming &middot; X 2016</h1>
						<p>Welcome to Day 2 of the Programming Event of MINET X 2016. We hope you have as much fun solving the problems as we had making them. You have been provided with the Code::Blocks and Turbo C++ environments.<br><br>
						The event will be three hours long. There are five rounds and each round comprises of three questions. Your answers will have a direct bearing on your team’s stock prices. The scoring method followed is the same as yesterday.<br><br>
						Whenever you wish to attempt a question, raise your hand and one of us will come to you. Note that whenever there is an unsuccessful attempt, the maximum points for a problem are halved. So, for instance, if you answer a question perfectly on your third try, you get one-fourth of the maximum points. Accessing any other site other than the links provided and communication between two or more teams is not permitted.<br><br>
						If you have any questions about the problems, do not be afraid to ask us.
						Have fun, and Make beautiful programs. Best of luck!</p>

							<h3>Tank Trouble</h3>
							
							<div class="question">
								<p id="question">
								A general decides to reward all $N$ of his cadets for doing well in their last exam. He places $N$ tanks in a base, and labels them $1$ to $N$. The cadets’ dog tags (again, labeled $1$ to $N$ for the corresponding cadet) are randomly shuffled and distributed among the tanks (one tag per tank).
<br><br>
Then, a game begins. The cadets will wait outside the base and—one by one—each cadet is allowed to go in and open up to $K$  tanks in search of his dog tag. 
The tags cannot be moved. After the cadet is done, he must close all the tanks and leave the base exactly as it was upon his entry. The cadets are not allowed to communicate with one another during the game.<br><br> 
If all $N$ cadets can find their dog tags, then they win; otherwise, they lose. Before starting the game, the cadets are given a moment to discuss a strategy for maximizing their chances of winning. No cadet has prior knowledge about the distribution of the dog tags. 
<br><br>
Assuming optimal play, what is the probability that $N$ cadets will win the game if they are allowed to look at up to $K$ tanks?

							<h3>Chanaz goes to catch em’ all</h3>
							
							<div class="question">
								
								<p id="question">
One day Chanaz got motivated to be the best, so she planned to catch Pokémon. She has to catch a total of $n$ Pokémon. But sadly, Chanaz is exhausted, so she works as follows :<br>
First she catches $v$ Pokémon, takes rest at the Pokémon Centre , then she catches as many as $[v / k]$ Pokémon, takes rest again, then catches $[v / (k^2)]$ Pokémon and so on, forming the sequence :<br>
$[v], [v / k], [v / k^2], [v / k^3], [v / k^4], [v / k^5], [v / k^6] ...$
The expression $[a / b]$ is regarded as the integral part from dividing number $a$ by number $b$, that is, the Greatest Integer Function(Floor function).<br><br>
The moment the value of $[v / (k^p)]= 0$, Chanaz stops and goes to sleep. Once she sleeps, she gives up on catching Pokémon. But she wants to have $n$ Pokémon till then.
<br><br>
Chanaz is wondering, what minimum value $v$ can take to let her catch not less than n Pokémon before she falls asleep. Can you help her?
							<br><br>
								<span class="bold">Input: </span>The input consists of two integers $n$ and $k$, separated by spaces — the Number of pokemon she has to catch, and the productivity reduction coefficient.<br><br>

								<b>Explanation: </b>
In the first sample the answer is $v$ = 4. Chanaz catches Pokémon as following: first 4 Pokémon, then 2, then 1, and then Chanaz falls asleep. Thus, she manages to catch 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 Pokémon in the night and complete the task.
<br>
In the second sample the answer is $v$ = 54. Chanaz catches Pokémon in the following portions: 54, 6. The total sum is 54 + 6 = 60, that's more than $n$ = 59.

							<h3>HP Calculation</h3>
<div class="question">

You are given the task to find pokemons and group them into teams.The criteria for the pokemons to be in one team is that when each digit of HP $N$ is raised to power $n$ and added, the sum is equal to $N$. Find the HP of each pokemon in the team and their sum. 
<br>
An example is given below: 
<br>
$1634 = 1^4+6^4+3^4+4^4$

								<p id="question">
Consider a game of Powered Nim where the computer is Player 1 and the checker is Player 2 . (Player 1 goes first.) <br><br>
The rules of the game are as follows:<br>
You will be given an integer $N$. A number has to be chosen in turns by  Player 1  and Player 2 from the set ${1,...,N}$. But, when someone has chosen a number they can also remove some or all powers of that number if they wish to. After a series of eliminations the one who can’t choose a number loses.<br><br>
Player 1 needs to play the game in a way where it always wins and when it’s impossible for it to win the output is -1.<br><br>
									<span class="bold">Input: </span>The first line of input will give you the value of $N$. The rest of the inputs of Player 2 are open.<br><br>

							<h3>Grid Game</h3>
							
							<div class="question">
								<p id="question">
Alice and Bob are playing a game. A single pawn is placed on a grid of  $X*Y$ size. Some cells on the grid have been marked as impassable. You can move the  pawn a positive number of steps along the row or column towards the origin. The pawn is not allowed to land on an impassable cell. Alice and Bob alternate moves, with Alice going first. The first player unable to make a move loses.<br>
 Assuming that  Bob is the checker your task is to make Alice play in a way that she always wins. When it is impossible for her to win, print $-1$.
<br><br>

									<span class="bold"><b>Input: </b></span>
The inputs of Bob (the checker) are open. Feel free to take the inputs any way you prefer but the method below is recommended.<br><br>
The input will begin with an integer $N$, the number of impassable cells.$N$ lines consist of  2 integers each: the $X$ and $Y$ coordinates of an impassable cell. Following that are 2 integers: the $X$ and $Y$ coordinates of the starting position of the pawn.

									<br><br>
									<span class="bold"><b>Output: </b></span>Print out the steps taken by Alice and the winner of the game. when it is not possible for her to win print $-1$<br><br>
